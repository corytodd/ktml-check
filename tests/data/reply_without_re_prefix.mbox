Kernels have a set of builtin trusted and revoked certificates as a
bundle.

It is not very easy to access them, one needs to either download linux
kernel package source code; or boot the kernel to look up builtin
hashes; and then find certificates externally.

It would be more convenient for inspection to expose these in the
buildinfo package, which already exposes auxiliary kernel information.

Seems fine as long those keys aren't secret.

These are not keys, but public well-known x.509 certificates embedded
in the pkcs7 signature on every signed vmlinuz.
The private keys for all of those are obviously inaccessible to any of
us, and are sealed in the singing service.
