Subject: [SRU Bionic/Focal/OEM-5.14/Jammy/HWE-5.17/Kinetic 0/1] CVE-2022-40768
Message-ID: <20221003153116.135309-1-cengiz.can@canonical.com>

[Impact]
drivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because
stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.

[Fix]
Fix is currently on linux-next.git only. There's a request to convert
it into two separate patches which won't effect the structure of the
fix.

[Test case]
For each target kernel, compile and boot tested on KVM only.

[Potential regression]
stex driver specific changes are harmless but the added const'ness to
scsi_sg_copy_from_buffer signature might be risky.

Linus Torvalds (1):
  scsi: stex: Properly zero out the passthrough command structure
